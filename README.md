# PlayerTracker
Can track players that are online Spigot/Bukkit with compass (basically you are dream now)

Usage:
Right click with a compass and select the player that you would like to track.
The compass will now point to the location of the player when you right clicked them.
This means that the compass is live and you will have to update it to get the current location of the player.
